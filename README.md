# NC Traffic Camera Scripts

This script is used to capture image from NC DOT traffic cameras, and look for use of heavy machinery to rebuild dunes during and after storm events. 

The work is motivated by a JGR-ES commentary written in 2019 by @edlazarus and myself: 

'Is there a Bulldozer in your model?'  https://doi.org/10.1029/2018JF004957

Script is currently running on a dedicated Raspberry Pi 4 in my office, and focused on several NC DOT traffic cameras:
